== Kubernetes PropertySource implementations

The most common approach to configuring your Spring Boot application is to create an `application.properties` or `application.yaml` or
an `application-profile.properties` or `application-profile.yaml` file that contains key-value pairs that provide customization values to your
application or Spring Boot starters. You can override these properties by specifying system properties or environment
variables.

=== Using a `ConfigMap` `PropertySource`

Kubernetes provides a resource named https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/configmap/[`ConfigMap`] to externalize the
parameters to pass to your application in the form of key-value pairs or embedded `application.properties` or `application.yaml` files.
The link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-kubernetes/tree/master/spring-cloud-kubernetes-fabric8-config[Spring Cloud Kubernetes Config] project makes Kubernetes `ConfigMap` instances available
during application bootstrapping and triggers hot reloading of beans or Spring context when changes are detected on
observed `ConfigMap` instances.

The default behavior is to create a `Fabric8ConfigMapPropertySource` based on a Kubernetes `ConfigMap` that has a `metadata.name` value of either the name of
your Spring application (as defined by its `spring.application.name` property) or a custom name defined within the
`bootstrap.properties` file under the following key: `spring.cloud.kubernetes.config.name`.

However, more advanced configuration is possible where you can use multiple `ConfigMap` instances.
The `spring.cloud.kubernetes.config.sources` list makes this possible.
For example, you could define the following `ConfigMap` instances:

====
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  application:
    name: cloud-k8s-app
  cloud:
    kubernetes:
      config:
        name: default-name
        namespace: default-namespace
        sources:
         # Spring Cloud Kubernetes looks up a ConfigMap named c1 in namespace default-namespace
         - name: c1
         # Spring Cloud Kubernetes looks up a ConfigMap named default-name in whatever namespace n2
         - namespace: n2
         # Spring Cloud Kubernetes looks up a ConfigMap named c3 in namespace n3
         - namespace: n3
           name: c3
----
====

In the preceding example, if `spring.cloud.kubernetes.config.namespace` had not been set,
the `ConfigMap` named `c1` would be looked up in the namespace that the application runs.

Any matching `ConfigMap` that is found is processed as follows:

* Apply individual configuration properties.
* Apply as `yaml` the content of any property named `application.yaml`.
* Apply as a properties file the content of any property named `application.properties`.

The single exception to the aforementioned flow is when the `ConfigMap` contains a *single* key that indicates
the file is a YAML or properties file. In that case, the name of the key does NOT have to be `application.yaml` or
`application.properties` (it can be anything) and the value of the property is treated correctly.
This features facilitates the use case where the `ConfigMap` was created by using something like the following:

====
[source]
----
kubectl create configmap game-config --from-file=/path/to/app-config.yaml
----
====

Assume that we have a Spring Boot application named `demo` that uses the following properties to read its thread pool
configuration.

* `pool.size.core`
* `pool.size.maximum`

This can be externalized to config map in `yaml` format as follows:

====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: demo
data:
  pool.size.core: 1
  pool.size.max: 16
----
====

Individual properties work fine for most cases. However, sometimes, embedded `yaml` is more convenient. In this case, we
use a single property named `application.yaml` to embed our `yaml`, as follows:

====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: demo
data:
  application.yaml: |-
    pool:
      size:
        core: 1
        max:16
----
====

The following example also works:

====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: demo
data:
  custom-name.yaml: |-
    pool:
      size:
        core: 1
        max:16
----
====

You can also configure Spring Boot applications differently depending on active profiles that are merged together
when the `ConfigMap` is read. You can provide different property values for different profiles by using an
`application.properties` or `application.yaml` property, specifying profile-specific values, each in their own document
(indicated by the `---` sequence), as follows:

====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: demo
data:
  application.yml: |-
    greeting:
      message: Say Hello to the World
    farewell:
      message: Say Goodbye
    ---
    spring:
      profiles: development
    greeting:
      message: Say Hello to the Developers
    farewell:
      message: Say Goodbye to the Developers
    ---
    spring:
      profiles: production
    greeting:
      message: Say Hello to the Ops
----
====

In the preceding case, the configuration loaded into your Spring Application with the `development` profile is as follows:

====
[source,yaml]
----
  greeting:
    message: Say Hello to the Developers
  farewell:
    message: Say Goodbye to the Developers
----
====

However, if the `production` profile is active, the configuration becomes:

====
[source,yaml]
----
  greeting:
    message: Say Hello to the Ops
  farewell:
    message: Say Goodbye
----
====

If both profiles are active, the property that appears last within the `ConfigMap` overwrites any preceding values.

Another option is to create a different config map per profile and spring boot will automatically fetch it based
on active profiles

====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: demo
data:
  application.yml: |-
    greeting:
      message: Say Hello to the World
    farewell:
      message: Say Goodbye
----
====
====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: demo-development
data:
  application.yml: |-
    spring:
      profiles: development
    greeting:
      message: Say Hello to the Developers
    farewell:
      message: Say Goodbye to the Developers
----
====
====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: demo-production
data:
  application.yml: |-
    spring:
      profiles: production
    greeting:
      message: Say Hello to the Ops
    farewell:
      message: Say Goodbye
----
====


To tell Spring Boot which `profile` should be enabled at bootstrap, you can pass `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` environment variable.
 To do so, you can launch your Spring Boot application with an environment variable that you can define it in the PodSpec at the container specification.
 Deployment resource file, as follows:

====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: deployment-name
  labels:
    app: deployment-name
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: deployment-name
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: deployment-name
	spec:
		containers:
		- name: container-name
		  image: your-image
		  env:
		  - name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
			value: "development"
----
====

You could run into a situation where there are multiple configs maps that have the same property names. For example:

====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: config-map-one
data:
  application.yml: |-
    greeting:
      message: Say Hello from one
----
====

and

====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: config-map-two
data:
  application.yml: |-
    greeting:
      message: Say Hello from two
----
====

Depending on the order in which you place these in `bootstrap.yaml|properties`, you might end up with an un-expected result (the last config map wins). For example:

====
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  application:
    name: cloud-k8s-app
  cloud:
    kubernetes:
      config:
        namespace: default-namespace
        sources:
         - name: config-map-two
         - name: config-map-one
----
====

will result in property `greetings.message` being `Say Hello from one`.

There is a way to change this default configuration by specifying `useNameAsPrefix`. For example:

====
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  application:
    name: with-prefix
  cloud:
    kubernetes:
      config:
        useNameAsPrefix: true
        namespace: default-namespace
        sources:
          - name: config-map-one
            useNameAsPrefix: false
          - name: config-map-two
----
====

Such a configuration will result in two properties being generated:

 - `greetings.message` equal to `Say Hello from one`.

 - `config-map-two.greetings.message` equal to `Say Hello from two`

Notice that `spring.cloud.kubernetes.config.useNameAsPrefix` has a _lower_ priority than `spring.cloud.kubernetes.config.sources.useNameAsPrefix`.
This allows you to set a "default" strategy for all sources, at the same time allowing to override only a few.

If using the config map name is not an option, you can specify a different strategy, called : `explicitPrefix`. Since this is an _explicit_ prefix that
you select, it can only be supplied to the `sources` level. At the same time it has a higher priority than `useNameASPrefix`. Let's suppose we have a third config map with these entries:


====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: config-map-three
data:
  application.yml: |-
    greeting:
      message: Say Hello from three
----
====

A configuration like the one below:

====
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  application:
    name: with-prefix
  cloud:
    kubernetes:
      config:
        useNameAsPrefix: true
        namespace: default-namespace
        sources:
          - name: config-map-one
            useNameAsPrefix: false
          - name: config-map-two
            explicitPrefix: two
          - name: config-map-three
----
====

will result in three properties being generated:

 - `greetings.message` equal to `Say Hello from one`.

 - `two.greetings.message` equal to `Say Hello from two`.

 - `config-map-three.greetings.message` equal to `Say Hello from three`.

NOTE: You should check the security configuration section. To access config maps from inside a pod you need to have the correct
Kubernetes service accounts, roles and role bindings.

Another option for using `ConfigMap` instances is to mount them into the Pod by running the Spring Cloud Kubernetes application
and having Spring Cloud Kubernetes read them from the file system.
This behavior is controlled by the `spring.cloud.kubernetes.config.paths` property. You can use it in
addition to or instead of the mechanism described earlier.
You can specify multiple (exact) file paths in `spring.cloud.kubernetes.config.paths` by using the `,` delimiter.

NOTE: You have to provide the full exact path to each property file, because directories are not being recursively parsed.

NOTE:  If you use `spring.cloud.kubernetes.config.paths` or `spring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.path` the automatic reload
functionality will not work.  You will need to make a `POST` request to the `/actuator/refresh` endpoint or
restart/redeploy the application.

=== Secrets PropertySource

Kubernetes has the notion of https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/[Secrets] for storing
sensitive data such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and so on. This project provides integration with `Secrets` to make secrets
accessible by Spring Boot applications. You can explicitly enable or disable This feature by setting the `spring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.enabled` property.

When enabled, the `Fabric8SecretsPropertySource` looks up Kubernetes for `Secrets` from the following sources:

. Reading recursively from secrets mounts
. Named after the application (as defined by `spring.application.name`)
. Matching some labels

*Note:* 

By default, consuming Secrets through the API (points 2 and 3 above) *is not enabled* for security reasons. The permission 'list' on secrets allows clients to inspect secrets values in the specified namespace.
Further, we recommend that containers share secrets through mounted volumes.

If you enable consuming Secrets through the API, we recommend that you limit access to Secrets by using an authorization policy, such as RBAC. 
For more information about risks and best practices when consuming Secrets through the API refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#best-practices[this doc].

If the secrets are found, their data is made available to the application.

Assume that we have a spring boot application named `demo` that uses properties to read its database
configuration. We can create a Kubernetes secret by using the following command:

====
[source]
----
kubectl create secret generic db-secret --from-literal=username=user --from-literal=password=p455w0rd
----
====

The preceding command would create the following secret (which you can see by using `kubectl get secrets db-secret -o yaml`):

====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: cDQ1NXcwcmQ=
  username: dXNlcg==
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2017-07-04T09:15:57Z
  name: db-secret
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: "357496"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/default/secrets/db-secret
  uid: 63c89263-6099-11e7-b3da-76d6186905a8
type: Opaque
----
====

Note that the data contains Base64-encoded versions of the literal provided by the `create` command.

Your application can then use this secret -- for example, by exporting the secret's value as environment variables:

====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ${project.artifactId}
spec:
   template:
     spec:
       containers:
         - env:
            - name: DB_USERNAME
              valueFrom:
                 secretKeyRef:
                   name: db-secret
                   key: username
            - name: DB_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                 secretKeyRef:
                   name: db-secret
                   key: password
----
====

You can select the Secrets to consume in a number of ways:

. By listing the directories where secrets are mapped:
+
====
[source,bash]
----
-Dspring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.paths=/etc/secrets/db-secret,etc/secrets/postgresql
----
====
+
If you have all the secrets mapped to a common root, you can set them like:
+
====
[source,bash]
----
-Dspring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.paths=/etc/secrets
----
====

. By setting a named secret:
+
====
[source,bash]
----
-Dspring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.name=db-secret
----
====

. By defining a list of labels:
+
====
[source,bash]
----
-Dspring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.labels.broker=activemq
-Dspring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.labels.db=postgresql
----
====

As the case with `ConfigMap`, more advanced configuration is also possible where you can use multiple `Secret`
instances. The `spring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.sources` list makes this possible.
For example, you could define the following `Secret` instances:

====
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  application:
    name: cloud-k8s-app
  cloud:
    kubernetes:
      secrets:
        name: default-name
        namespace: default-namespace
        sources:
         # Spring Cloud Kubernetes looks up a Secret named s1 in namespace default-namespace
         - name: s1
         # Spring Cloud Kubernetes looks up a Secret named default-name in whatever namespace n2
         - namespace: n2
         # Spring Cloud Kubernetes looks up a Secret named s3 in namespace n3
         - namespace: n3
           name: s3
----
====

In the preceding example, if `spring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.namespace` had not been set,
the `Secret` named `s1` would be looked up in the namespace that the application runs.


.Properties:
[options="header,footer"]

| `spring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.enabled`   | `Boolean` | `true`                       | Enable Secrets `PropertySource`
| `spring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.name`      | `String`  | `${spring.application.name}` | Sets the name of the secret to look up
| `spring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.namespace` | `String`  | Client namespace             | Sets the Kubernetes namespace where to look up
| `spring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.labels`    | `Map`     | `null`                       | Sets the labels used to lookup secrets
| `spring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.paths`     | `List`    | `null`                       | Sets the paths where secrets are mounted (example 1)
| `spring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.enableApi` | `Boolean` | `false`                      | Enables or disables consuming secrets through APIs (examples 2 and 3)
|===

Notes:

* The `spring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.labels` property behaves as defined by
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-Configuration-Binding#map-based-binding[Map-based binding].
* The `spring.cloud.kubernetes.secrets.paths` property behaves as defined by
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-Configuration-Binding#collection-based-binding[Collection-based binding].
* Access to secrets through the API may be restricted for security reasons. The preferred way is to mount secrets to the Pod.

You can find an example of an application that uses secrets (though it has not been updated to use the new `spring-cloud-kubernetes` project) at
https://github.com/fabric8-quickstarts/spring-boot-camel-config[spring-boot-camel-config]

=== `PropertySource` Reload

WARNING:  This functionality has been deprecated in the 2020.0 release.  Please see
the <<spring-cloud-kubernetes-configuration-watcher>> controller for an alternative way
to achieve the same functionality.

Some applications may need to detect changes on external property sources and update their internal status to reflect the new configuration.
The reload feature of Spring Cloud Kubernetes is able to trigger an application reload when a related `ConfigMap` or
`Secret` changes.

By default, this feature is disabled. You can enable it by using the `spring.cloud.kubernetes.reload.enabled=true` configuration property (for example, in the `application.properties` file).

The following levels of reload are supported (by setting the `spring.cloud.kubernetes.reload.strategy` property):

* `refresh` (default): Only configuration beans annotated with `@ConfigurationProperties` or `@RefreshScope` are reloaded.
This reload level leverages the refresh feature of Spring Cloud Context.

* `restart_context`: the whole Spring `ApplicationContext` is gracefully restarted. Beans are recreated with the new configuration.
In order for the restart context functionality to work properly you must enable and expose the restart actuator endpoint
[source,yaml]
====
----
management:
  endpoint:
    restart:
      enabled: true
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: restart
----
====

* `shutdown`: the Spring `ApplicationContext` is shut down to activate a restart of the container.
 When you use this level, make sure that the lifecycle of all non-daemon threads is bound to the `ApplicationContext`
and that a replication controller or replica set is configured to restart the pod.

Assuming that the reload feature is enabled with default settings (`refresh` mode), the following bean is refreshed when the config map changes:

====
[java, source]
----
@Configuration
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "bean")
public class MyConfig {

    private String message = "a message that can be changed live";

    // getter and setters

}
----
====

To see that changes effectively happen, you can create another bean that prints the message periodically, as follows

====
[source,java]
----
@Component
public class MyBean {

    @Autowired
    private MyConfig config;

    @Scheduled(fixedDelay = 5000)
    public void hello() {
        System.out.println("The message is: " + config.getMessage());
    }
}
----
====

You can change the message printed by the application by using a `ConfigMap`, as follows:

====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: reload-example
data:
  application.properties: |-
    bean.message=Hello World!
----
====

Any change to the property named `bean.message` in the `ConfigMap` associated with the pod is reflected in the
output. More generally speaking, changes associated to properties prefixed with the value defined by the `prefix`
field of the `@ConfigurationProperties` annotation are detected and reflected in the application.
<<configmap-propertysource,Associating a `ConfigMap` with a pod>> is explained earlier in this chapter.

The full example is available in https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-kubernetes/tree/main/spring-cloud-kubernetes-examples/kubernetes-reload-example[`spring-cloud-kubernetes-reload-example`].

The reload feature supports two operating modes:
* Event (default): Watches for changes in config maps or secrets by using the Kubernetes API (web socket).
Any event produces a re-check on the configuration and, in case of changes, a reload.
The `view` role on the service account is required in order to listen for config map changes. A higher level role (such as `edit`) is required for secrets
(by default, secrets are not monitored).
* Polling: Periodically re-creates the configuration from config maps and secrets to see if it has changed.
You can configure the polling period by using the `spring.cloud.kubernetes.reload.period` property and defaults to 15 seconds.
It requires the same role as the monitored property source.
This means, for example, that using polling on file-mounted secret sources does not require particular privileges.

| `spring.cloud.kubernetes.reload.monitoring-secrets`      | `Boolean` | `false`                      | Allow monitoring changes in secrets

| `spring.cloud.kubernetes.reload.mode`                    | `Enum`    | `event`                      | Specifies how to listen for changes in property sources (`event` or `polling`)
| `spring.cloud.kubernetes.reload.period`                  | `Duration`| `15s`                        | The period for verifying changes when using the `polling` strategy
|===

Notes:
* You should not use properties under `spring.cloud.kubernetes.reload` in config maps or secrets. Changing such properties at runtime may lead to unexpected results.
* Deleting a property or the whole config map does not restore the original state of the beans when you use the `refresh` level.
