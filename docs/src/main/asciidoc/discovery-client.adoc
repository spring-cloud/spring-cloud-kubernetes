== DiscoveryClient for Kubernetes

This project provides an implementation of https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-commons/blob/master/spring-cloud-commons/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/client/discovery/DiscoveryClient.java[Discovery Client]
for https://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes].
This client lets you query Kubernetes endpoints (see https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/services/[services]) by name.
A service is typically exposed by the Kubernetes API server as a collection of endpoints that represent `http` and `https` addresses and that a client can
access from a Spring Boot application running as a pod.

This is something that you get for free by adding the following dependency inside your project:

====
HTTP Based `DiscoveryClient`
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-kubernetes-discoveryclient</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
====

NOTE: `spring-cloud-starter-kubernetes-discoveryclient` is designed to be used with the
<<spring-cloud-kubernetes-discoveryserver, Spring Cloud Kubernetes DiscoveryServer>>.

====
Fabric8 Kubernetes Client
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-kubernetes-fabric8</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
====

====
Kubernetes Java Client
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-kubernetes-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
====

To enable loading of the `DiscoveryClient`, add `@EnableDiscoveryClient` to the according configuration or application class, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableDiscoveryClient
public class Application {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
  }
}
----
====

Then you can inject the client in your code simply by autowiring it, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java]
----
@Autowired
private DiscoveryClient discoveryClient;
----
====

You can choose to enable `DiscoveryClient` from all namespaces by setting the following property in `application.properties`:

====
[source]
----
spring.cloud.kubernetes.discovery.all-namespaces=true
----
====

To discover service endpoint addresses that are not marked as "ready" by the kubernetes api server, you can set the following property in `application.properties` (default: false):

====
[source]
----
spring.cloud.kubernetes.discovery.include-not-ready-addresses=true
----
NOTE: This might be useful when discovering services for monitoring purposes, and would enable inspecting the `/health` endpoint of not-ready service instances.
====

If your service exposes multiple ports, you will need to specify which port the `DiscoveryClient` should use.
The `DiscoveryClient` will choose the port using the following logic.

1. If the service has a label `primary-port-name` it will use the port with the name specified in the label's value.
2. If no label is present, then the port name specified in `spring.cloud.kubernetes.discovery.primary-port-name` will be used.
3. If neither of the above are specified it will use the port named `https`.
4. If none of the above conditions are met it will use the port named `http`.
5. As a last resort it wil pick the first port in the list of ports.

WARNING:  The last option may result in non-deterministic behaviour.
Please make sure to configure your service and/or application accordingly.

By default all of the ports and their names will be added to the metadata of the `ServiceInstance`.

If, for any reason, you need to disable the `DiscoveryClient`, you can set the following property in `application.properties`:

====
[source]
----
spring.cloud.kubernetes.discovery.enabled=false
----
====

Some Spring Cloud components use the `DiscoveryClient` in order to obtain information about the local service instance. For
this to work, you need to align the Kubernetes service name with the `spring.application.name` property.

NOTE:  `spring.application.name` has no effect as far as the name registered for the application within Kubernetes

Spring Cloud Kubernetes can also watch the Kubernetes service catalog for changes and update the
`DiscoveryClient` implementation accordingly.  In order to enable this functionality you need to add
`@EnableScheduling` on a configuration class in your application.
