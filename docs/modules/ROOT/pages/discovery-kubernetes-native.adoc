:page-section-summary-toc: 1

Kubernetes itself is capable of (server side) service discovery (see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#discovering-services).
Using native kubernetes service discovery ensures compatibility with additional tooling, such as Istio (https://istio.io), a service mesh that is capable of load balancing, circuit breaker, failover, and much more.

The caller service then need only refer to names resolvable in a particular Kubernetes cluster. A simple implementation might use a spring `RestTemplate` that refers to a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), such as `https://\{service-name}.\{namespace}.svc.\{cluster}.local:\{service-port}`.

Additionally, you can use Hystrix for:

* Circuit breaker implementation on the caller side, by annotating the spring boot application class with `@EnableCircuitBreaker`
* Fallback functionality, by annotating the respective method with `@HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod=`
