# Purpose

Explain how integration tests can be run against any k8s cluster. 
One way of running such a kubernetes cluster locally which is leveraged by our CI setup is [microk8s](https://microk8s.io/)
The Kubernetes resources necessary to get the test application
onto the cluster are created using the [Fabric8 Maven Plugin](https://maven.fabric8.io/) and the
lifecycle of the test applications is controlled by [Arquillian Cube](http://arquillian.org/arquillian-cube/)

# Basics

With JKube and Arquillian Cube setup for our project we need to configure the following things in order to properly get
our test applications onto our cluster of choice:

* The `KUBECONFIG` environment variable needs to be set to the location of the Kubernetes configuration file
we will use to access our cluster (this can be skipped if this file is already present in the standard locations that kubectl assumes)
* The `jkube.docker.host` system property needs to be set to the URL where the docker daemon we will use to build images is listening
This can be skipped when we use the default unix socket on a Linux machine
* The Docker image registry were out built images will be stored needs to be set using the `image.registry` environment variable   

# Instructions

Here we will describe the steps that are needed to setup microk8s and the maven command we will use to run the integration
tests against that microk8s cluster 

## Running tests with microk8s
### Install microk8s

```bash
sudo snap install microk8s --classic --channel=1.11/stable
sleep 10
echo n | microk8s.enable dns registry istio
```

Ensure everything is running by inspecting the output of:

```bash
microk8s.kubectl get all --all-namespaces
```

It should look something like:

```
NAMESPACE            NAME                                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

```

Export the kube config file that will be used to access this cluster

```bash
microk8s.kubectl config view --raw > /tmp/kubeconfig
```

For the istio tests to work, we need a namespace that is properly configured for Istio injection.
Such a namespace called `istio-test` can easily be created using:

```bash
microk8s.kubectl create -f .circleci/istio-test-namespace.yml
``` 

### Launch tests

```bash
cd spring-cloud-kubernetes-integration-tests
KUBECONFIG=/tmp/kubeconfig mvn -Djkube.docker.host='unix:///var/snap/microk8s/current/docker.sock' clean package verify -Pk8s,it,spring
```

The command above will for each test project:

* Build the ubjerjar
* Build a docker image based on that uberjar
* Launch the Arquillian Cube tests which will
    - Deploy the application to the cluster
    - Launch the test code
    - Undeploy the application
  
## Running tests with Docker Desktop

[Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) and [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) 
provide a Kubernetes server runs within a Docker container on your local system. This is similar to `microk8s` but is only currently available on Mac or Windows.

### Configure Docker Desktop
* Ensure you are running the Edge release of Docker Desktop
** For Mac `brew cask install docker-edge`
** For Windows `choco install docker-desktop --pre` 
* Increase default resources as the defaults are not sufficient. Allocate 8GB of Ram
![Docker Resources](https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/platform-setup/docker/dockerprefs.png)
* [Enable Kubernetes cluster](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#kubernetes)
* Run a local insecure docker registry 
** `docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:2`
* [Configure the Docker daemon to trust the local registry](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#daemon) 
* Export the docker config `kubectl config view --raw > /tmp/kubeconfig`
* Run the tests `KUBECONFIG=/tmp/kubeconfig mvn -Djkube.docker.host='unix:///var/snap/microk8s/current/docker.sock' clean package verify -Pk8s,it,spring`

## Launching one of the applications manually

Each of the test modules can also be launched manually. This can be very useful for debugging purposes.
For example to launch the `simple-core` application
    
 ```bash
 cd spring-cloud-kubernetes-integration-tests/simple-core
 KUBECONFIG=/tmp/kubeconfig mvn -Djkube.docker.host='unix:///var/snap/microk8s/current/docker.sock' clean package verify -Pk8s,it,spring
 ```
 
 When it's time to take down the application, simply execute: 
 

 ```bash
  KUBECONFIG=/tmp/kubeconfig mvn k8s:undeploy -Pk8s
  ```
