Writing a new integration test should be done with minor things in mind, so that
tests are picked up by our CI/CD pipeline and work as expected. In particular when you
define the plugin that builds the image (integrations tests have a docker image build),
you must name the image with the same name as the module. For example:


<plugin>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
	<configuration>
		<imageName>docker.io/springcloud/${project.artifactId}:${project.version}</imageName>
		<imageBuilder>paketobuildpacks/builder</imageBuilder>
	</configuration>
	<executions>
		<execution>
           <id>build-image</id>
           <configuration>
              <skip>${skip.build.image}</skip>
           </configuration>
           <phase>package</phase>
           <goals>
              <goal>build-image</goal>
           </goals>
        </execution>
        <execution>
           <id>repackage</id>
           <phase>package</phase>
           <goals>
              <goal>repackage</goal>
           </goals>
        </execution>
	</executions>
</plugin>

Notice this line:

    <imageName>docker.io/springcloud/${project.artifactId}:${project.version}</imageName>

You must follow the same convention.

One more important part in this configuration is : "<skip>${skip.build.image}</skip>".
We use this setting in the build pipeline where in some stages we skip the image build,
only to have it build in some latter ones.
